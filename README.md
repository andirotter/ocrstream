# OCRstream

OCRstream is a plugin for the ResourceSpace Digital Asset Management to integrate Optical Character Recognition through tesseract-ocr.

Tesseract OCR needs to be installed for the plugin to work. See the Wiki [Links](https://github.com/andirotter/ocrstream/wiki/Links) for places to find downloads and/or instructions to build tesseract-ocr.
